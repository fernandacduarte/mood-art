Simple and fun app. 
Just playing with React and learning some new web skills (inspired by Andrei Neagoie course "The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery").

## Here you will find
  - A simple react app with clean code and one-way data flow
  - Http requests using axios (and a commented sample using fetch)
  - A nice search mechanism based on synonyms (using the [Wordnet database](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/))
  - A cool flip effect triggered on hover
  - Some cool art works from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/)
  - Some inspitartional quotes using a [free API](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373)
